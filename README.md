# Welcome
Rxx is a library of unofficial reactive LINQ extensions and types supplementary to [Reactive Extensions (Rx) for .NET](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/Rx.NET).

# Goals
1. The Rxx project is designed to provide LINQ extensions and types that we (the contributors) believe are useful in real-world applications and are not currently present in the Microsoft Reactive Extensions for .NET (Rx) libraries.
1. Rxx is NOT meant to supersede Rx, but to supplement it.  We may prefer for our extensions to be included in Rx and will remove any duplication from our libraries as they evolve.
1. Rxx is delivered as [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rxx) to make distribution and integration into your applications easier.
1. Community feedback and contributions will help guide the evolution of Rxx.
