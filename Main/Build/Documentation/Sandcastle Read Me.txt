Overview

This project uses Microsoft Sandcastle and the HTML Help Workshop compiler to 
build reference documentation into a .chm file.  Any Conceptual documentation that
we offer is written in wiki format and hosted on our project's Documentation tab on 
CodePlex: http://rxx.codeplex.com/Documentation

Note that we're using White Tie to automate Sandcastle (SHFB), among on other build tasks.

How To Build Documentation

To build the .chm file, you'll first need to install the latest release of Sandcastle 
with the latest style patches applied.  The Sandcastle Guided Installer from the 
Sandcastle Styles project on CodePlex is no longer available.  As of Oct. 2012, you 
must install the Sandcastle Help File Builder utility to obtain the latest version 
of Sandcastle.

When you've completed the Sandcastle Guided Installer you may need to reboot your 
computer for the environment changes to take effect.

After Sandcastle is installed, simply change the current solution configuration to 
Release mode and then build the solution normally.  You'll find the .chm file in the 
solution's deployment folder after the build completes.  For example: 

	Deployment\Release\{Project}\{Project}.chm

Each of the projects that target different platform versions of the .NET Framework, 
such as Rxx, Rxx-Silverlight and Rxx-Phone, will generate their .chm files in their 
own CodePlex deployment folders.

Note:
	Sandcastle freezes Visual Studio and it can take quite a long time, especially on a 
	computer with low memory or a slow hard drive.  Just be patient.  Wait a few minutes 
	for Sandcastle to complete.  Its build log will appear in the output window when it's
	done, after which the build will resume by executing the deployment packaging tasks.
