Rxx Deployment Procedure

	Date				Author				Changes
	5/4/2011		Dave S.				First draft
	6/24/2011		Dave S.				Updates for Rxx 1.1 completed.
	9/14/2012		Dave S.				Removed "Experimental" from folder paths.


Targets:

	CodePlex
	http://rxx.codeplex.com/

	NuGet
	http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Rxx
	You must request the API key from a project coordinator to deploy to this location.

Procedure:

	Building the solution in Release mode automatically creates deployment packages 
	for CodePlex and NuGet, but it does not deploy them.  Follow these instructions
	to build these packages and then verify and deploy them manually.

	Release mode is not recommended for building inside Visual Studio.  Instead, double-click the 
	solution's Build\RxxBuild.bat file to build the solution in a console window.

	You will need the latest version of Sandcastle installed and patched to produce the 
	documentation.  See the "Sandcastle Read Me.txt" file in the solution's Build\Documentation\
	folder for details.


	** Reminder **
	Increment the minor version numbers in the AssemblyInfoShared.cs file and each of 
	the projects' AssemblyInfo.cs files before building the deployment package.


	1. Switch to Release mode in Visual Studio.
	2. Build the entire solution.
	3. Run all unit tests and expect "green" for all results.
	4. Verify deployment packages.
		 a. Unzip each package and verify that its contents are complete and correct.
				I. To verify NuGet packages (.nupkg), add the .zip extension to the filename or use NuGet Package Explorer: 
					 http://nuget.codeplex.com/releases/view/59864
				II. To verify .chm files simply double-click them.

				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx\{DateTime}\CodePlex\Rxx.chm
				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx\{DateTime}\CodePlex\Rxx.zip
				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx\{DateTime}\NuGet\Rxx.{Version}.nupkg
				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx\{DateTime}\NuGet\Rxx.{Version}.symbols.nupkg
				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx\{DateTime}\Symbols\Rxx.Symbols.zip

				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx-Silverlight 5\{DateTime}\CodePlex\Rxx-Silverlight 5.chm
				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx-Silverlight 5\{DateTime}\CodePlex\Rxx-Silverlight 5.zip
				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx-Silverlight 5\{DateTime}\Symbols\Rxx-Silverlight 5.Symbols.zip

				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx-Phone 7.1\{DateTime}\CodePlex\Rxx-Phone 7.1.chm
				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx-Phone 7.1\{DateTime}\CodePlex\Rxx-Phone 7.1.zip
				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx-Phone 7.1\{DateTime}\Symbols\Rxx-Phone 7.1.Symbols.zip
				
				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx.Labs\{DateTime}\CodePlex\Rxx.Labs.zip
				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx.Labs\{DateTime}\Symbols\Rxx.Labs.Symbols.zip

				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx.Labs-Silverlight 5\{DateTime}\CodePlex\Rxx.Labs-Silverlight 5.zip
				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx.Labs-Silverlight 5\{DateTime}\Symbols\Rxx.Labs-Silverlight 5.Symbols.zip

				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx.Labs-Phone 7.1\{DateTime}\CodePlex\Rxx.Labs-Phone 7.1.zip
				Deployment\Release\Stable\Rxx.Labs-Phone 7.1\{DateTime}\Symbols\Rxx.Labs-Phone 7.1.Symbols.zip

	5. Extract and run the console labs to verify stability.  (Smoke test)
		 a. Extract all files from Rxx.Labs.zip and execute RxxLabs.exe.
		 b. Manually run various labs and check their output.
	6. Extract and run the Silverlight labs to verify stability.  (Smoke test)
		 a. Extract all files from Rxx.Labs-Silverlight N.zip and then double-click the 
				Rxx.Labs.SilverlightTestPage.html file to start the application.
		 b. Manually run various labs and check their output.
	7. Extract and run the Windows Phone labs to verify stability.  (Smoke test)
		 a. Extract all files from Rxx.Labs-Phone 7.N.zip and then double-click Deploy.bat.
		 b. If you have a registered device you may deploy to that device; otherwise, choose 
				the Windows Phone 7 Emulator and click the Deploy button.
		 c. Manually run various labs and check their output.
	8. Ensure that the "Release Notes.txt" file in the Deployment folder is up-to-date.
		 a. Add the latest release notes to the top of the Release Notes wiki on CodePlex.
				http://rxx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Release%20Notes
	9. Ensure that the "Features.txt" file in the Deployment folder is up-to-date.
		 a. Add the latest features to the Features wiki on CodePlex.
				http://rxx.codeplex.com/documentation
	10. Check-in all pending changes.
	11. Deploy all .zip and .chm files to CodePlex.
			a. Associate the last check-in with the current release in CodePlex.
	12. Run the NuGetPush.bat script to deploy the NuGet package.
		  a. You can simply double-click this .bat file in Windows Explorer.
			b. It’s located in the same folder as the NuGet package file.
	13. Browse the existing documentation on CodePlex and update as necessary.

...and don't forget to let people know about the deployment!
